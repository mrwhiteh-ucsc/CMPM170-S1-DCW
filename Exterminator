        He has the kind of face that stops you in your tracks. He must get used to that, the sudden pause in a person's natural expression when they looked his way followed by overcompensating with a nonchalant gaze and a weak smile. It doesn't help that he is so proud of it - a mere thought about Mr. X is repulsive. He was ugly alright, but inside he was simply disgusting.

    ->Asking
* {BPlot == BPlotList.Exorcist} [Are you sure that it's working]
