        The microwave. Much like the many other appliances that line the granite countertops of this kitchen, It is mostly chrome. The front consists of a tinted window, handle, and button pad with a multitude of functions besides the numbers. A totally, ordinary, microwave.

            Pressing the largest button on the machine, it pops open with a *cling*. The inside of the microwave lights up. Nothing inside - as pristine as the rest of this kitchen. You close the microwave door, with nothing of interest gain.

            Looking at the microwave, nothing has changed. It is as clean as it was the first time.
